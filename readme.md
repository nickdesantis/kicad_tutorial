# PCB Tutorial
This repo is to support a tutorial in which we'll learn how to make our own printed circuit boards (PCBs) with Kicad by laying out a simple audio amplifier.

## Goals
While we'll be using Kicad, all of the skills we'll be learning are transferrable to other EDA packages:
* Schematic capture
* Board layout
* Part creation and libraries
* Producing outputs for production

## Motivation
Why make our own PCBs?
* When you want more than one of something
* Better signal intengrity
* Breadboarding gets unmanagable pretty quickly
* It's cheap!
* More parts! Through hole packages are becoming rarer and rarer - for the cost of one breakout board, you could do 2 or 3 PCB spins!

## Prerequisites
* It's best if you can bring your own laptop
* [Download and Install Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/)
* Bring a mouse
* Some knowledge of circuits would be handy
